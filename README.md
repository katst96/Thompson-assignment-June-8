<h2><a id="S_Town_2"></a>S Town</h2>

<p>Brian Reed is the main guy running the podcast. But the interviewee, John, does take up a lot of minutes sharing his personal anecdotes.<br>
Skylar</p>
<h3><a id="Scripted_8"></a>Scripted?</h3>
<h4><a id="Yes_10"></a>Yes</h4>
<p>Advertisements in the beginng are scripted.<br>
Transition piece after John’s phone call explaining how Brian ended up visiting him is scripted.<br>
End credits read are scripted.</p>
<h4><a id="No_16"></a>No</h4>
<p>I don’t think the phone calls between Brian and John is scripted since it is a phone call.<br>
Actual sounds from John and Brian’s first meeting in person is not scripted.<br>
Conversation with Skylar is not scripted.</p>
<h3><a id="Role_of_Interviews_22"></a>Role of Interviews</h3>
<p>This podcast relies heavily on interviews in the beginning but is complemented by Brian’s narroration shortly after.</p>

<p>Sarah Koenig is the main narrorator of this podcast.<br>
Various kids at the the high school</p>
<h3><a id="Scripted_48"></a>Scripted?</h3>
<h4><a id="Yes_50"></a>Yes</h4>
<p>The question asked to people about what they did six weeks before<br>
I can’t really tell if the opening message was scripted, Sarah makes it sound more natural. I assume it is definitely scripted</p>
<h4><a id="No_54"></a>No</h4>
<p>The responses to the six week questions</p>
<h3><a id="Role_of_Interviews_58"></a>Role of Interviews</h3>
<p>Interviews are more paraphrased and individual quotes are chopped and snipped into only the most important parts.<br>
Snipits from the police interviews are played.<br>
Most interviews are phone interviews but there are some in person interviews.</p>
<h3><a id="Sound_Effects_64"></a>Sound Effects</h3>
<ol>
<li>Intro piano music</li>
<li>Transition guitar music</li>
<li>Guitar background music</li>
<li>Chilling background/transition music</li>
</ol>
<h1><a id="Comparisions_72"></a>Comparisions</h1>
<p>I think I liked Serial better becuase it was more report-like versus S Town which felt like more of a story and had a lot of bulk chatter.</p>
